## üîÑ **ITERATION PROCESS**

If something doesn't work:

1. **Check the prompt** - Is it clear and specific?
2. **Review the specs** - Are design specs followed?
3. **Test incrementally** - Build feature by feature
4. **Compare with original** - Use this tool as reference
5. **Adjust and retry** - Modify prompt and regenerate

---

## üí° **TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS**

### **For AI Assistants**
1. **Be specific** - Reference exact file names and line numbers
2. **One step at a time** - Don't try to build everything at once
3. **Test frequently** - Check each feature as it's built
4. **Use examples** - Show the AI what you want
5. **Iterate** - Refine prompts based on results

### **For Developers**
1. **Read all prompts first** - Understand the full scope
2. **Follow the order** - Sequential prompts build on each other
3. **Don't skip steps** - Each prompt is important
4. **Test as you go** - Catch issues early
5. **Customize freely** - These are templates, not rules

---
